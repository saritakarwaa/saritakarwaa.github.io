            I'm Sarita Karwa, a final-year Computer Science student at IGDTUW, transforming ideas into interfaces, one keystroke at a time. 
            My web development journey started with a curiosity about how websites work, and it has evolved into a 
            into a passion for solving real-world problems through thoughtful code and design.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm deeply passionate about core computer science subjects and love diving into topics like data structures, algorithms,backend systems, and system design. I enjoy problem-solving, experimenting with new technologies, and constantly expanding my knowledge. My curiosity drives me to explore how things work â€” from frontend interactions to backend logic.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, you can find me reading about the latest web technologies and learning new tech. In my free time, I love watching movies, listening to music or simply spending quality time with friends and family.
